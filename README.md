### Introduction

The Bettermode Community Web Application is a clone of Bettermode's posts list and gallery, featuring fake authentication. Built with ReactJS and ViteJS, the app uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design and dark/light theme functionality. It leverages GraphQL and React Query for efficient data fetching and mutations. The project also includes robust unit testing using Vitest and Testing Library/React to ensure high-quality and maintainable code.

### Features

The Bettermode Community Web Application offers the following features:

1. **Authentication**: Users can sign in and sign out to access the application.  
2. **Posts List Gallery**: A responsive and visually appealing gallery displaying a list of posts.  
3. **Post Details**: View detailed information about individual posts.  
4. **Post Reactions**: Users can react to posts with likes or other reactions.  
5. **Dark and Light Theme**: Users can switch between dark and light themes for a personalized experience.  
6. **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a seamless user experience across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### Getting Started

To set up and run the **Bettermode Community Web Application** locally, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmdrn/bettermode-community.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the project directory
Move into the cloned project directory:
```bash
cd bettermode-community
```

#### 3. Install dependencies
Install the necessary packages by running:
```bash
yarn
```

#### 4. Prepare the `.env` file
To run the application properly, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. This file will store the necessary environment variables required by the application. **It is crucial that you set up the authentication token correctly, or the application will not function as expected.**

This application uses **fake login** because the developers do not have access to the exact authentication mechanism of the real Bettermode application. Instead, they implemented a fake authentication system, where the email, password, and a valid authorization token must be added to the `.env` file.

### `.env` file structure:

```plaintext
VITE_AUTH_TOKEN="<your-auth-token>" # JWT authentication token (must be a real, valid token)
VITE_SPACE_ID="<space-id>" # Space identifier (optional: Leave empty string)
VITE_POST_TYPE_ID="<post-type-id>" # Post type identifier (optional: Leave empty string)
VITE_DEFAULT_FETCH_POSTS_LIMIT=8 # The default maximum number of posts to fetch per request
VITE_DEFAULT_THEME="light" # Default theme setting for the application ("light" or "dark")
VITE_API_ORIGIN="https://api.bettermode.com" # API base URL
VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD="<your-auth-password>" # Default authentication password
VITE_AUTH_EMAIL="<your-auth-email>" # Default authentication email
```

- **`VITE_DEFAULT_FETCH_POSTS_LIMIT`**: Sets the default number of posts to fetch per request.
- **`VITE_DEFAULT_THEME`**: Specifies the application's default theme (e.g., "light" or "dark").
- **`VITE_API_ORIGIN`**: The base URL for the Bettermode API.

Important Notes:

- **`VITE_AUTH_TOKEN`**: This is a critical value. You must add a real and `valid JWT authorization token` here to access the `Bettermode API`. If this token is incorrect or missing, the application will not be able to fetch posts or authenticate users properly.
- **`VITE_AUTH_PASSWORD and VITE_AUTH_EMAIL`**: These values are used for fake authentication. You can set any email and password here, but they must match what you input when logging in. Upon successful login, the token from this environment variable will be stored in the user's `cookies`.
    After logging in with the correct credentials, the application will store a token key in the user's cookies, which will allow the user to access the posts list tied to that token.


Authentication Flow:

- After setting up the `.env` file, navigate to `/signin`.
- Enter the `email and password` defined in the `.env` file. If the credentials are correct, the application will log you in and store the token in your cookies.
- Once logged in, the user will be redirected to the home page and can access the `/posts` route to see the posts list tied to the provided token.

#### 5. Run the development server
Start the development server with:
```bash
yarn dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

#### 6. Explore the application
Open your browser and navigate through the following routes:

- **`/`**: The home page displaying project documentation.
- **`/signin`**: A fake login mechanism is implemented here.  
  - To use it, add your credentials and a valid authorization token to the `.env` file.  
  - Upon successful login, a `token` will be stored in the user's cookies.  
  - The user will then be redirected to the home page, enabling access to the posts list.
- **`/posts`**: Displays a paginated list of posts.  
  - Users must be signed in to view this page.  
  - Posts include their associated reactions, and a "Show More" button enables navigation to subsequent pages.  
  - Pagination does not use URL search params, so refreshing the page will reset to the first page.
```
